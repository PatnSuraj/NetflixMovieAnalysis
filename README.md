In this project, we analyze and process Netflix's dataset to uncover trends and patterns in its content library. Through data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), we identify insights into content distribution, popular genres, and notable directors and actors. Using the processed dataset, we also explore potential predictive models that could help Netflix understand content popularity and recommend relevant shows and movies to users.
